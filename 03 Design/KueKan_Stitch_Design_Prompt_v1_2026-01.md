## Responsive Behavior

### Mobile-First Priority
"All designs must be optimized for mobile screens (375px-428px width) as primary interface. Use bottom navigation for main sections. Implement thumb-zone friendly button placement (lower third of screen for primary actions)."

### Tablet Adaptation
"For tablet screens (768px+), transition to 2-column layout for catalog/lists. Side navigation appears for admin console."

### Desktop Enhancement
"Desktop admin console (1280px+) uses full dashboard layout with sidebar navigation, multiple data visualizations side-by-side, and keyboard shortcuts."

---

## Accessibility Requirements

### Thai Language Support
"All UI text must display correctly in Thai script with proper line-breaking and character spacing. Support Thai numerals option alongside Arabic numerals."

### Contrast Ratios
"Maintain WCAG AA compliance with minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for body text, 3:1 for large text."

### Touch Targets
"Minimum 44x44px touch targets for all interactive elements per iOS guidelines."

### Loading States
"Include skeleton screens for all data-heavy views. Use Thai loading messages: 'กำลังโหลด...' with subtle animation."

---

## Special Design Considerations

### LINE Integration
"Design screens to work within LINE LIFF (LINE Front-end Framework) browser. Include LINE-style green accent color (#00B900) for LINE-specific features. Design share cards optimized for LINE chat preview (1200x630px)."

### Cultural Sensitivity
"Incorporate Thai cultural elements respectfully:
- Use Thai color symbolism (gold for prestige, green for prosperity)
- Include Thai pattern motifs (ลายไทย) in subtle background elements
- Respect royal imagery protocols
- Use appropriate Thai honorifics in copy (คุณ, ท่าน)"

### Gamification Visual Language
"Create excitement through:
- Confetti animations on mission completion
- Progress bars with smooth animations
- Achievement unlock modals with celebratory effects
- Tier upgrade ceremonies with dramatic reveals
- Point earning feedback with coin animation"

### Economic Infrastructure Aesthetic
"Balance playful gamification with professional credibility:
- Use official government-approved color schemes for PAO sections
- Include Chamber of Commerce branding where appropriate
- Display security badges and PDPA compliance indicators
- Show transparent data sourcing and calculations"
