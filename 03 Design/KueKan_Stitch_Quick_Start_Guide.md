## Common Refinements

After Stitch generates initial designs, use these to refine:

balance numbers larger and add a coin animation when points increase.
Use warmer teal shade.
```

### For Mission Cards
```
Make the mission card photography show real Korat landmarks. Add a progress
indicator showing how many users completed this mission. Make the point
badge more prominent with gold metallic gradient.
```

### For Rewards
```
Update product photos to show authentic Thai OTOP handicrafts with natural
lighting. Add "Limited" tags in red for scarce items. Show distance to
redemption location below each card.
```

### For Partner Scanner
```
Make the scanning frame larger and add green success animation when QR is
detected. Show last 3 transactions below scanner with timestamp and customer
name. Add haptic feedback indicator.
```

### For Admin Dashboard
```
Increase data density - show more KPIs in the header section. Make the Korat
map heat map more prominent. Add real-time update indicator. Use professional
navy blue instead of teal for admin sections.

## Common Issues & Fixes

**Issue:** Colors look too playful for enterprise use
**Fix:** "Make the color palette more professional - use deeper teal (#008B82) and reduce saturation by 20%"

**Issue:** Thai text is too cramped
**Fix:** "Increase line-height to 1.6 for all Thai text and add more padding around text elements"

**Issue:** Too much information on one screen
**Fix:** "Simplify this screen - show only the top 3 KPIs in the header and move detailed stats to a separate view"

**Issue:** Images don't reflect Thai culture
**Fix:** "Update all imagery to show authentic Korat landmarks and Thai local businesses with warm, natural photography"

**Issue:** Design feels too generic
**Fix:** "Add Thai cultural touches - subtle ลายไทย pattern backgrounds and use gold accent color for premium elements"

## Ready-to-Use: First Session Script

**Copy this entire conversation into Stitch:**

```
Hi Stitch! I'm designing a Thai loyalty rewards platform called KueKan.

First, create the customer home screen: A vibrant mobile home screen showing
a points balance of "2,450 แต้ม" prominently. Use teal (#00B8A9) and gold
(#FFD93D) colors. Include 3 mission cards below with photos of Thai landmarks.
Bottom navigation bar. Rounded corners everywhere. Encouraging, game-like feel
for Thai users.

[Wait for generation]

Great! Now make the points balance bigger and add a subtle coin icon. Make
the background have a very subtle Thai pattern. Use Thai font "Prompt" for
headings.

[Wait for refinement]

Perfect! Now let's create mission cards: Design a card showing a Korat landmark
photo, mission title in Thai, gold coin with "+50 แต้ม", distance indicator,
and time remaining badge. Make it exciting and achievable-looking.

[Continue iterating...]
