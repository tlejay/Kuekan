# Stitch Prompt Guide: Effective Prompting

This guide provides instructions for crafting effective prompts to design and refine your app with Stitch.

## 1. Starting Your Project

Choose to start with a broad concept or specific details. For complex apps, start high-level and then drill down on details screen by screen.

### High-Level vs. Detailed Prompts

**High-Level (for brainstorming/complex apps):** Start with a general idea.

> **Prompt Example:** "An app for marathon runners."

**Detailed (for specific results):** Describe core functionalities for a better starting point.

> **Prompt Example:** "An app for marathon runners to engage with a community, find partners, get training advice, and find races near them."

### Set the Vibe with Adjectives

Use adjectives to define the app’s feel (influences colors, fonts, imagery).

> **Vibe Prompt Example 1:** "A vibrant and encouraging fitness tracking app."

> **Vibe Prompt Example 2:** "A minimalist and focused app for meditation."

## 2. Refining Your App by Iterating Screen by Screen

### Refine with Specific, Incremental Changes

Stitch performs best with clear, specific instructions. Focus on one screen/component and make one or two adjustments per prompt.

**Be Specific:** Tell Stitch what to change and how.

> **Prompt Example 1:** "On the homepage, add a search bar to the header."

> **Prompt Example 2:** "Change the primary call-to-action button on the login screen to be larger and use the brand's primary blue color."

### Focus on Specific Screens/Features

> **Example 1 (E-commerce Detail Page):** "Product detail page for a Japandi-styled tea store. Sells herbal teas, ceramics. Neutral, minimal colors, black buttons. Soft, elegant font."

> **Example 2 (E-commerce Detail Page):** "Product detail page for Japanese workwear-inspired men's athletic apparel. Dark, minimal design, dark blue primary color. Minimal clothing pictures, natural fabrics, not gaudy."

### Describe Desired Imagery

Guide the style or content of images.

> **Example (Specific Image Style):** "Music player page for 'Suburban Legends.' Album art is a macro, zoomed-in photo of ocean water. Page background/imagery should reflect this."

## 3. Controlling App Theme

### Colors

Request specific colors or describe a mood for the color palette.

> **Specific Color Prompt:** "Change primary color to forest green."

> **Mood-Based Color Prompt:** "Update theme to a warm, inviting color palette."

### Fonts & Borders

Modify typography and element styling (buttons, containers).

> **Font Style Prompt:** "Use a playful sans-serif font." OR "Change headings to a serif font."

> **Border/Button Style Prompt:** "Make all buttons have fully rounded corners." OR "Give input fields a 2px solid black border."

> **Combined Theme Example:** "Book discovery app: serif font for text, light green brand color for accents."

## 4. How to Modify Images in Your Design

### Be Specific When Changing Images

Clearly identify the image to modify. Use descriptive terms from the app’s content.

> **Targeting General Images:** "Change background of [all] [product] images on [landing page] to light taupe."

> **Targeting a Specific Image:** "On 'Team' page, image of 'Dr. Carter (Lead Dentist)': update her lab coat to black."

### Coordinate Images with Theme Changes

If updating theme colors, specify if images should also reflect these changes.

> **Prompt:** "Update theme to light orange. Ensure all images and illustrative icons match this new color scheme."

## 5. Changing the Language of Your App’s Text

Use the following prompt:

> **Prompt:** "Switch all product copy and button text to Spanish."
